            "This was my first time taking therapy, and the therapist made me feel safe. Showing
            vulnerability is really hard, but she made it so easy."
            <cite>- RG</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="card quote-card">
            "I was doubtful about therapy, but that aspect of the therapist addressing my concerns
            from my POV is what I like the most. Her way of explaining things, or countering my
            arguments, felt very intuitive. Her patience while explaining things to me, and the way
            she provides a comfortable, non-judgemental space for me to open up without being
            overbearing or condescending, is something that I feel comfortable the most."

            "The therapist's communication was spot on! She made it comfortable to talk, and I felt
            she understood the situation I was facing."
